# online-store-project
This project is originally for an internship acceptance test (still awaiting result) where a server code was provided (original server code: https://github.com/scandiweb/junior-react-endpoint)

I built the entire frontend of the web app and improved the server by adding the ability to make orders, update order statuses and store products and orders data on a MongoDB database instead of locally on the server.

## Tech stack used: 
- Create React App, Apollo Client, Nodejs, Apollo Server, and MongoDB.
## Code:

- Backend code: https://github.com/mohagras903/online-store-api.git
